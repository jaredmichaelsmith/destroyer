# Destroyer

Unfollow and unfriend social media users with a burning passion.

##Overview:
Destroyer will mercilessly remove your followers and friends from various social networks, with current support for only Twitter.

##Disclaimer:
1. Due to the fact that Facebook does **NOT** let you unfriend your friends programatically, Facebook integration is not available at this time.
2. I wrote this in an hour during my stay at the beach during Labor Day, but I hope to continue development and maintenance when I can. Therefore, I also encourage any interested in Destroyer to contribute to the effort of purging all of you social media feed clutter generated from your despised friends and followers.
